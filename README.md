### ðŸŒŸ What I Learned

Through this project, I enhanced my understanding of **HTML and CSS** by designing a visually appealing and responsive card layout. I learned to use **flexbox** for layout alignment and applied custom **CSS properties** like `box-shadow`, `border-radius`, and `hover effects` to improve the UI/UX. Additionally, I explored how to embed and style **QR codes** effectively, ensuring a seamless user interface. This project also helped me practice writing clean and modular code, improving my front-end development skills. By researching and using design inspiration from tools like **Frontend Mentor**, I gained insight into creating professional-looking layouts while refining my knowledge of design principles.


To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
